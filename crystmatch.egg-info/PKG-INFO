## Introduction

A solid-solid phase transition establishes an *atom-to-atom correspondence* between crystal structures $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$. Such correspondence is called a *crystal-structure match* (CSM) [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05278). A CSM can be described by a pair of [POSCAR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/POSCAR) files, which specifies how the lattice deforms from $\mathcal A$ to $\mathcal B$ and the correspondence between atoms in a supercell of $\mathcal A$ and atoms in $\mathcal B$.

The main functions of `crystmatch` are as follows:

- **Enumeration**:
  - Provide a comprehensive list of candidate sublattice matches (SLMs) [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05278) between two given crystal structures, with user-specified upper bounds on the multiplicity [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05278) and root-mean-square strain (RMSS).
  - Provide the representative CSM of a given SLM, i.e., the CSM with the lowest root-mean-square displacement (RMSD).
  - (In progress) Provide a list of CSMs with user-specified upper bounds on the multiplicity, RMSS, and RMSD.

- **Analysis**:
  - Read a CSM from a pair of [POSCAR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/POSCAR) files, and save CSMs in the same format.
  - Score CSMs by RMSS and root-mean-square displacement (RMSD).
  - Benchmark a CSM by its deviation angle from an orientation relationship (OR).

## Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.9 or later** installed. You can check it by running:

```
$ python3 --version
```

Clone this repository and navigate to the directory where `setup.py` is located, run:

```
$ pip3 install .
```

Check whether `crystmatch` is successfully installed:

```
$ crystmatch --version
```

## Usage

To run `crystmatch`, one of the following modes must be selected:

1. **Enumeration mode**: Use `-E` or `--enumerate` to generate a list of CSMs, then perform preliminary analysis.
2. **Analysis mode**: Use `-A` or `--analyze` to read CSM(s) from [POSCAR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/POSCAR) files (or `CSM_LIST.dat` if provided), then perform detailed analysis. If `CSM_LIST.dat` is provided, you can export specific CSMs using `--export index1 [index2 ...]`.

The initial and final crystal structures should be specified in the form of [POSCAR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/POSCAR) files, unless in the analysis mode and `CSM_LIST.dat` is provided.

If you don't specify any mode or crystal structures, `crystmatch` will ask for input.

## Examples

- To generate a list of representative [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05278) CSMs between two crystal structures stored in `./fcc` and `./bcc`, with a maximum multiplicity of `2` and a maximum RMSS of `0.1`:

  ```
  $ crystmatch --initial fcc --final bcc --enumerate 2 -0.1
  ```
  
  The following files will be created in the current directory:

  ```text
  ./
  ├── CSM_LIST(fcc-bcc-m2s0.1).dat    # stores the enumerated CSMs and their properties.
  ├── PLOT(fcc-bcc-m2s0.1).pdf        # shows the RMSD-RMSS distribution of the CSMs.
  └── TABLE(fcc-bcc-m2s0.1).csv       # organizes the properties of each CSM.
  ```

- To export the CSMs with indices `7` and `10` from `CSM_LIST(foo).dat`:

  ```
  $ crystmatch --analyze CSM_LIST(foo).dat --export 7 10
  ```

  Two folders will be created in the current directory, each containing a pair of [POSCAR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/POSCAR) files representing the CSM, as:

  ```
  ./
  ├── CSM_7(foo)/
  │   ├── POSCAR_I
  │   └── POSCAR_F
  └── CSM_10(foo)/
      ├── POSCAR_I
      └── POSCAR_F
  ```

- To benchmark CSMs in `CSM_LIST(foo).dat` by their deviation angles from the OR $(111)_A\parallel(110)_B,[1\bar{1}0]_A\parallel[001]_B$:

  ```
  $ crystmatch --analyze CSM_LIST(foo).dat --orientation 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 -1 0 0 0 1
  ```

  The arguments after `--orientation` must be **cartesian coordinates**.

  The ORs are determined via the rotation-free manner by default, and you can also use `--fixusp` to determine ORs via the USF-fixed manner; see Ref. [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05278) for their definitions.

- To see all available options:

  ```
  $ crystmatch --help
  ```

## As Python package

`crystmatch` is more flexible in Python scripts. Please see the [documentation (in progress)]().
