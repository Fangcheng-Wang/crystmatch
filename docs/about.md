# About

**Crystmatch** is developed by the **[Xin-Zheng Li (李新征) Group](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/xzli/index.htm)** at the School of Physics, Peking University. Our research focuses on computer simulations of material properties, covering a wide range of first-principles methods in condensed matter physics and theoretical chemistry, as well as some fundamental theories in statistical physics. These methods and theories include, for example:

- **Path-integral** methods for the description of statistical nuclear quantum effects (closed-path and open-path; distinguishable particles and bosonic or fermionic systems),

- The **instanton** method for quantum tunneling,

- The **initial value representation** method for quantum dynamics,

- **Crystal structure matching** for solid-solid phase transitions,

- **Non-equilibrium Green's function theory** for quantum friction and quantum dragging, and

- The **Yang-Lee theory** for phase transitions.

In addition to our research group, we would like to express our gratitude to:

- Dr. Félix Therrien, for his pioneering work and guidance on orientation analysis;

- Yi-Chi Zhang (张亦弛), for his crucial feedback on shuffle distance calculations;

- Wuji Han (韩无极) and Zhilin Chang (常稚林), for their contributions to parallelization.
