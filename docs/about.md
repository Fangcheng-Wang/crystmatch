# About

`crystmatch` is developed by the **[Xin-Zheng Li (李新征) Group](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/xzli/index.htm) at the School of Physics, Peking University**. Our research focuses on computer simulations of material properties, covering a wide range of first-principles methods in condensed matter physics and theoretical chemistry, as well as some fundamental theories in statistical physics. These methods and theories include, for example:

- Path-integral methods for the description of statistical nuclear quantum effects (closed-path & open-path, distinguishable particles and bosonic or fermionic systems),

- The instanton method for quantum tunneling,

- The initial value representation method for quantum dynamics,

- Crystal structure matching for solid-solid phase transitions,

- Non-equilibrium Green's function theory for quantum friction and quantum dragging, and

- The Yang-Lee theory for phase transitions.

In addition to the research group, we would like to express our gratitude to:

- Dr. Félix Therrien, for his pioneering work and guidance on orientation analysis;

- Yi-Chi Zhang (张亦弛), for his crucial feedback on RMSD calculations;

- Zhilin Chang (常稚林), for his contributions to parallelization.
